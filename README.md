# FastTraceViewerForAndroid

# ⚠️ This project is deprecated ⚠️

Simple viewer for open fast trace content.
It uses openfasttrace's own import classes, so it should support
all file formats openfasttrace itself supports.

The focus of this app was learning Kotlin,Android's Architecture Components and Dagger.

Because *openfasttrace* uses `java.nio.Paths`, it runs only on Android 8.0 or higher.
